# terrible-calculator
This was a great learning experience but a terrible calculator 
I was trying to see if i could make a calculator in which you pressed button to change a varible to that value.
This value then would be look up and used in a script in which I didn't know that == checks if a varible is equal to a value
This meant I manule wrote out every possible combination
It took a look time to check the value of the operation since it wasn't a number.
